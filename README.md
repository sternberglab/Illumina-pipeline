This repo contains the code for interpreting and analyzing Illumina sequencing data. 

The intermediates should be safe to remove (and can be automatically deleted as the script runs, see the parameters), but keep the files in the "outputs" directory so that you can easily graph the results and tweak them to see results. 






###TODO:
- use unique reads, not fingerprints
- import os in fingerprinting
- cap y axis on zoomed chart
- add in donot and spike mapping reads to the read_aligner
- remove plot_overlap option
-
